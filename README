pyqtdeploy-demo
==================================================================================
This project is an effort a non-happy path demo for pyqtdeploy. There can be a
number of problems getting a project up and running with pyqtdeploy. These problems
can be difficult to troubleshoot. This project is meant to track some common
problems in pyqtdeploy and associated python extensions modules, demonstrate
solutions to them, and serve as an example for non-straightfoward pyqtdeploy
project elements listed below under "Goals". like including a sip/pyqt module, third-party python+cpython module,
etc.

Goals: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch Qt before build.
- Include a custom pure sip/CPython+Python extension.
- Include a custom CPython+Python extension that extends Qt
- Include python+pyqt application code
    - Import and use all included custom sip extensions.
    - Include png resource files in application code.
- Be able to run un-deployed application via source for development.
- Copy-pastable TLDR commands to get a working app binary (if possible)
    - Include any necessary changes to sip/pyqt/pyqtbuilder/etc extension code.

Problems Discovered in Chronological Order (base pyqt-demo)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Prerequisite python environment?
    - `pip install sip, pyqt5, pyqt-builder`
    - Have to make a choice for venv, choosing pipenv.
        - ** Created Pipfile, .venv dir to house venv in project dir.
- Why build-demo.py over just TLDR copy-pasta commands?
    - pyqtdeploy-sysroot, pyqtdeploy-build, cd build-macos-64 && qmake, make -j16
    - Could see as instructive example but can be unclear if it's necessary
    - Could see helpful to copy pyqt-demo.py.dat, but why not just do that in the release tarball?
    - Can also obscure underlying use of executables, basic sip/pyqtdeploy-* concepts.
- Building sysroot (pyqtdeploy-sysroot)
    - took two days with some experience with Qt, PyQt*
    - Always recommend --verbose for pyqtdeploy-* to troubleshoot inevitable errors
    - pyqtdeploy-sysroot --verbose sysroot.toml
    - troubleshooting build errors is timeconsuming without option for parallel builds
        - ** Added PYQTDEPLOY_SYSROOT_JOBS env var to `pyqtdeploy` and `pyqtbuild`
    - Compile error in Qt-5.15.2-6 on macos: https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/recipes/qt/6.x.x/patches/dece6f5.patch
        - Had to move `#include <CoreGraphics/CGColorSpace.h>` to first include in file.
        - Had to:
            1. Create new archive qt-everywhere-src-5.15.6-patched.tar.xz
            2. Create debuggable pythons script version of pyqtdeploy-build "exe" that
                to step through pyqtdeploybuild_main, to understand pyqtdeploy plugin arch, etc.
            3. Create new Qt.py in root project dir to point to new source path instead
                of pyqtdeploy automatically downloading buggy source tarball.
- Building qmake project (pyqtdeploy-build)
    - Worked out of the box
- Generating makefiles (qmake)
    - Run w/ relative path to qmake in sysroot: ./sysroot-macos-64/Qt/bin/qmake
    - Then worked
- Compiling project sources (make)
    - Compiled + Linked out of the box
- Running binary (./pyqt-demo)
    - ERROR
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "pyqt-demo.py", line 269, in <module>
            File "pyqt-demo.py", line 224, in create_qscintilla_code_view
            File "pyqt-demo.py", line 190, in get_source_code
            File ":/importlib/resources.pyo", line 103, in read_text
            File ":/importlib/resources.pyo", line 82, in open_text
            File ":/importlib/resources.pyo", line 46, in open_binary
        SystemError: <class 'pdytools.qrcresource'> returned NULL without setting an exception
        - Had to read code for `pdytools`

Changes To Original pyqt-demo Concept
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Renamed `data/pyqt-demo.py.dat` to `data/the_divine_comedy.txt`
    - Re-using the source file is helpful for the running demo but makes it
        harder to understand how the project is organized.
- Added ./Qt.py component plugin to patch Qt-5.15+ on macOS.


The Original pyqt-demo README
==================================================================================

This directory contains a simple widget-based demonstration application
(pyqt-demo.py) that will build on all supported target platforms.  When run it
displays various pieces of information about what is included in the
application.

TLDR For Building on macOS
(NOTE: Inferring basic usage of pyqtdeploy-* from scripts, etc is cumbersome
for new people, and historically the api/concepts change often enough that older
uses have to do this too. TLDR's for common cookbook examples can help with this.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
export PATH=$PATH:<PATH_TO_QMAKE_EXE>
pyqtdeploy-sysroot --target macosx sysroot.toml
pyqtdeploy-build --target macosx pyqt-demo.pdt
qmake


Building using build-demo.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The build-demo.py will first build a sysroot (using the specification in
sysroot.toml) and then build the application itself.

build-demo.py will not build a sysroot if it finds an existing one.  The
'--build-sysroot' option to build-demo.py will rebuild the sysroot even if one
already exists.

By default build-demo.py will build a native application.  On macOS the
'--target' option can be used to build applications for iOS and Android.  It
should also be possible to build Android applications on Windows and Linux but
this isn't tested.

build-demo.py will download the source code for the different components
(Python, OpenSSL, Qt, SIP, PyQt etc.) automatically.  However for iOS and
Android targets Qt must be installed using the binary installers from The Qt
Company.  The '--qmake' option must be used to specify the full path of the
qmake executable in the Qt installation.
