This directory contains a simple widget-based demonstration application
(pyqt-demo.py) that will build on all supported target platforms.  When run it
displays various pieces of information about what is included in the
application.

TLDR For Building on macOS
(NOTE: Inferring basic usage of pyqtdeploy-* from scripts, etc is cumbersome
for new people, and historically the api/concepts change often enough that older
uses have to do this too. TLDR's for common cookbook examples can help with this.)

qmake


Building using build-demo.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The build-demo.py will first build a sysroot (using the specification in
sysroot.toml) and then build the application itself.

build-demo.py will not build a sysroot if it finds an existing one.  The
'--build-sysroot' option to build-demo.py will rebuild the sysroot even if one
already exists.

By default build-demo.py will build a native application.  On macOS the
'--target' option can be used to build applications for iOS and Android.  It
should also be possible to build Android applications on Windows and Linux but
this isn't tested.

build-demo.py will download the source code for the different components
(Python, OpenSSL, Qt, SIP, PyQt etc.) automatically.  However for iOS and
Android targets Qt must be installed using the binary installers from The Qt
Company.  The '--qmake' option must be used to specify the full path of the
qmake executable in the Qt installation.
